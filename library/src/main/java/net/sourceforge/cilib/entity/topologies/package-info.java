/**
 * This package contains different topology implementations. Within CIlib, all {@linkplain Entity}
 * objects are capable of being contained within <tt>Topology</tt> instances.
 *
 * <p>
 * A topology is a structure through which the algorithm operates with {@linkplain Entity}s. As a
 * result, this data structure is a key component to any algorithm.
 *
 * <p>
 * Currently, the topologies are designed mainly for populations of entity instances. The expansion
 * of the topology into a structure that can be used within applications of other algorithm types is
 * being developed.
